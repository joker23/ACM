Note there was a single large piece of errata on the first problem
(Good Versus Evil).  The worth of wizards on the side of evil should
have been the same as the side of good, which is 10.  When the problem
was translated to .tex, the evil wizard value was mistakenly listed
as 11.  The posted solutions are all based on the value of 10.

During the contest, we updated the judge solution to incorporate a value
of 11 for evil wizards as was (incorrectly) listed on the problem
statement.
