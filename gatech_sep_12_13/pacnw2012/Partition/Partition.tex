The Ents are known as the shepherds of the forest. Treebeard, the oldest living
Ent in Middle Earth, needs to determine which trees he is to shepherd and which
trees are to be shepherded by his young fellow Ent, Bregalad. They have a
rectangular portion of Fangorn forest containing an even number of trees that
they need to divide into two pieces using a single straight boundary line.  In
order to equitably distribute the workload, Treebeard and Bregalad have
decided that each of their halves of the forest need to contain equal area and
contain an equal number of trees. If a tree lies exactly on the dividing line,
then that tree is counted in one or the other of the halves of the forest but
not both.  Any tree exactly on the dividing line may be assigned to
either Treebeard or Bregalad.

%Given a rectangle, along with an even number of points in its interior, find a
%way to split the points evenly into two halves with a single cut; that is,
%partition the points into two sets $A$ and $B$ of equal size such that there exists
%a straight line that divides the rectangle into two pieces of equal area
%corresponding to the two sets.  If a point lies exactly on the dividing line,
%it is counted in exactly one set of your choice.

\section{Input}

Input will consist of multiple test cases.  Each test case begins with a line
with 3 space-separated integers $N$, $W$, and $H$, denoting the number of
trees, the width of the forest, and the height of the forest, respectively.
The forest's four corners are $(0,0)$, $(W,0)$, $(0,H)$, and $(W,H)$.
Following this line are $N$ lines each with a pair of space-separated integers
$x_i$ and $y_i$ denoting the coordinates of the 
$i^{\mbox{\scriptsize{th}}}$
tree.  Furthermore,
\begin{itemize}

\item $2 \le N \le 50000$, $2 \le W \le 10000$, $2 \le H \le 10000$, $N$ is even, $W$
and $H$ are not both even.
\item $0 < x_i < W$, $0 < y_i < H$ for all $i$.  All locations of
trees are distinct.
\end{itemize}

%\item $2 \le N \le 50000$, $2 \le W \le 10000$, $2 \le H \le 10000$, $N$ is even, $W$
%and $H$ are not both even.
%\item $0 < x_i < W$ for all $i$, $0 < y_i < H$ for all $i$.  All points are distinct.

Input will be terminated with a case where $N = W = H = 0$, which should not be processed.

\section{Output}

For each test case, print out $N/2$ lines.  On each line, print two
space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$, denoting the coordinates of the 
$i^{\mbox{\scriptsize{th}}}$
tree in the half of the forest that is to be shepherded by Treebeard.

%For each test case, print out $N/2$ lines.  On each line, print two
%space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$, denoting the coordinates of the $i$th
%point in set $A$.
