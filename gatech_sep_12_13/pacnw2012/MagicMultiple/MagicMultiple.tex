The Elvish races of Middle Earth believed that certain numbers were more
significant than others.  When using a particular quantity $n$ of metal to
forge a particular sword, they believed that sword would be most powerful if
the thickness $k$ were chosen according to the following rule:

Given a nonnegative integer $n$, what is the smallest $k$ such that the
decimal representations of the integers in the sequence:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    n,\quad 2n,\quad 3n,\quad 4n,\quad 5n,\quad \ldots,\quad kn
\end{eqnarray*}
contain all ten digits (0 through 9) at least once?

Lord Elrond of Rivendell has commissioned you with the task to develop
an algorithm to find the optimal thickness ($k$) for any given quantity of
metal ($n$).

\section{Input}

Input will consist of a single integer $n$ per line.  The end of input
will be signaled by end of file.  The input integer will be between 1
and 200,000,000, inclusive.

\section{Output}

The output will consist of a single integer per line, indicating the
value of $k$ needed such that every digit from 0 through 9 is seen 
at least once.
