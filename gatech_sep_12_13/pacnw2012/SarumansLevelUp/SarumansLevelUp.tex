\title{Saruman's Level Up}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Saruman's army of orcs and other dark minions continuously mine and harvest
lumber out of the land surrounding his mighty tower for $N$ continuous days.
On day number $i$, Saruman either chooses to spend resources on mining coal and
harvesting more lumber, or on raising the level (i.e., height) of his tower.
He levels up his tower by one unit only on days where the binary representation
of $i$ contains a total number of 1's that is an exact multiple of 3.  Assume
that the initial level of his tower on day 0 is zero.

For example, Saruman will level up his tower on day 7 (binary 111), 
next on day 11 (binary 1011) and then day 13, day 14, day 19, and so 
on.

Saruman would like to forecast the level of his tower after $N$ 
days.  Can you write a program to help?

\section{Input}

The input file will contain multiple input test cases, each on a single line.
Each test case consists of a positive integer $N < 10^{16}$, as described
above. The input ends on end of file.

\section{Output}

For each test case, output one line: ``\verb+Day N: Level = L+", where \verb+N+ is 
the input $N$, and \verb+L+ is the number of levels after $N$ days.
