\title{Practice Problem:
 Print the Last Character\\ 
Time limit 2 seconds}
\date{}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

Write a program that reads lines of text from input and prints the last character in each line.

%NOTE: Do not use this problem for frivolous submissions, clarifications, or testing how judges 
%will respond.  Doing so may disqualify your team from the contest.

\section{Input}

The input will start with a line containing a single non-negative integer 
value specifying the number of lines of text that will follow.  Following 
the integer will be the specified number of lines.  See the Sample Input 
section below for clarification.  Each line of text will contain no more 
than 20 characters.

NOTE: All input for each problem in the contest will come from standard in 
(stdin / cin / System.in).  Note that you will not prompt for input, 
rather you will just read it in.  Testing is typically done by redirecting 
input from a file that contains the data necessary for your program, while 
at the command prompt.  If you are unsure how to do this, seek help from 
one of the contest staff.
\section{Output}

For each line read, write the last character in that line (the character 
that precedes the carriage return at the end of that line).  That character 
is guaranteed to be a non-whitespace character.  See the Sample Output section 
below for clarification.  Follow the format shown exactly. Failure to do so 
will result in an ``\verb+Output Format Error+''. 
% Part of any problem in the 
%contest includes properly formatting your output as per the problem 
%specifications.  If you have the right answer, but in the wrong format, 
%it still counts as a wrong answer, so be sure you carefully adhere to the 
%output specifications.

NOTE: All output for each problem in the contest (including this one) will 
be written to stdout / cout / System.out
