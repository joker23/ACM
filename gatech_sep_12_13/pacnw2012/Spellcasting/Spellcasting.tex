The casting of a spell is a continuous process.  One begins with a certain
amount of energy (measured in mana), which can be used to summon elements into
the spell.  Each element can be summoned in any quantity instantaneously by
consuming energy, at which point it immediately becomes a part of the spell,
providing power (measured in mana per second) from now on.  This power causes
energy to accumulate over time, which can in turn be used to summon additional
elements.  We continue this process until the total power output of our spell
reaches a required level.

There is one complication in this process, which experienced spellcasters will
exploit to cast spells more effectively.  Each element can have up to one
parent element, which supports its summoning, making it cost half as much
energy as it usually does if the parent element is already present.  For
example, if element A supports element B and element C, we could summon 1 unit
of element A first at full cost, and then summon 0.5 unit of element B and 0.5
unit of element C at half cost.  If we were to then summon 0.5 more unit of
element C, that portion would be at full energy cost again, since the 1 unit of
element A is already supporting other elements.  Note that all 3 elements
contribute their full power output to the spell; supporting does not interfere
with power output in any way, nor does it consume an element.

Given an initial amount of energy, a target amount of power, and a description
of the spell elements available for summoning, figure out how to cast a spell
that reaches the target amount of power in a minimum amount of time.

\section{Input}

Input will consist of multiple test cases.  Each test case begins with a line
with 3 space-separated integers $N$, $E$, and $P$, denoting the number of
elements, the starting energy (in mana), and the target power (in mana per
second) respectively.  Following this line are $N$ lines, the
$i^{\mbox{\scriptsize{th}}}$ of which describes element $i$ by the three
space-separated integers $e_i$, $p_i$, and $parent_i$ denoting the energy cost
to summon, the power output, and the index of the parent element (1-indexed;
$parent_i = 0$ if element $i$ has no parent element).

Constraints include:
\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \le N \le 1000$, $1 \le E \le 10^9$, $1 \le P \le 10^9$.
\item $1 \le e_i \le 10^9$ for all $i$, $0 \le p_i \le 10^9$ for all $i$, $0
\le parent_i \le N$ for all $i$.
\item At least one $p_i$ will be positive.
\item No element is its own ancestor; in other words, no element is capable of supporting itself, whether directly or indirectly.
\end{itemize}

Input will be terminated with a case where $N = E = P = 0$, which should not be processed.

\section{Output}

For each test case, print out a single line with a single integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to reach the target power (rounded up to the nearest integer).
