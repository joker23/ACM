When Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are at the Green Dragon Inn drinking ale, they
like to play a little game with parchment and pen to decide who buys the next round.  The
game works as follows: 

Given an $m \times n$ rectangular tile with each square marked with one of the
incantations \texttt{W}, \texttt{I}, and \texttt{N}, find the maximal number of
triominoes that can be cut from this tile such that the triomino has \texttt{W}
and \texttt{N} on the ends and \texttt{I} in the middle (that is, it spells
\texttt{WIN} in some order).  Of course the only possible triominoes are the
one with three squares in a straight line and the two ell-shaped ones.
The Hobbit that is able to find the maximum number wins and chooses who buys
the next round.  Your job is to find the maximal number.  

Side note: Sam and Pippin tend to buy the most rounds of ale when they play this game,
so they are lobbying to change the game to Rock, Parchment, Sword (RPS)!

\section{Input}

Each input file will contain multiple test cases.  Each test case consists of
an $m \times n$ rectangular grid (where $1 \le m, n \le 30$) containing only
the letters \texttt{W}, \texttt{I}, and \texttt{N}.  Test cases will be
separated by a blank line.  Input will be terminated by end-of-file.

\section{Output}

For each input test case, print a line containing a single integer indicating
the maximum total number of tiles that can be formed.
